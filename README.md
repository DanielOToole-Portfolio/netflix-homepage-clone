# netflix-homepage-clone
This Small Project was made with React.js and Firebase. It mimics the design and basic functionality of the Netflix Homepage. It uses the react-youtube and movie-trailers packages to show either show/ movies trailers or related video on Youtube. When you click on Netflix show/ movie posters a Youtube video pop-up will appear below it.
